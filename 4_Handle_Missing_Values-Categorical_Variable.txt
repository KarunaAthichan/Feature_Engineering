Categorical Variable:
i) Categorical variables are those values in a dataset that are selected from a group of categories or labels. 
ii) Categorical represents discrete values. These are also often iii) The discrete values can be text or numeric in nature (or even unstructured data like images).

There are two types:
1) Nominal - No orders. 
For e.g., cat, dog, rat, horse
2) Ordinal - Orders are necessary, based on ranking.
For e.g., Phd, Masters, Bachelor, Secondary school.

Handle Missing Values in Categorical Variable

1) Delete the rows
2) Replace with the most frequent values - It leads to Data imbalance.
3) Apply Classifier algorithm to predict. 
For e.g., missing value column is dependent and the remaining columns are independent including output column. Use the independent columns and output column to predict the missing values.
4) Apply Unsupervised ML
For e.g., use K Nearest Neighbour for predict the missing value.
