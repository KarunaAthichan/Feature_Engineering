Why Feature Scaling?

Every feature has Magnitudes & Units.

e.g., Height is 180 cms, and Weight is 79 kgs. Without feature scaling, machine learning model will give higher weightage to height column, nd it affects some of the ML models. 

Scaling required for below models:
Model uses Gradient Descend and Euclidean distance.
1) Linear Regression.
2) K Means Clustering.
3) K Nearest Neighbour.
4) Deep Learning Models (ANN, CNN, RNN).

Scaling doesn't needed for below models.
Model uses Ensemble methods
1) Decision Tree
2) Random Forest
3) Xgboost
